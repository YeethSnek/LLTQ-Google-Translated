After the coronation, in a private ceremony with the High Priestess, Elodie was officially offered her mother's Lumen crystal. She refused to accept it. For the first time in centuries, magic would have no hold on the throne of Nova.
After Elodia ascended the throne in a special ceremony with the king, she received the Lumen Crystal from her mother. I don't agree. For the first time in a long time, magic no longer rules Nova's throne.
After the coronation, in a private ceremony with the High Priestess, Elodie was officially offered her mother's Lumen crystal. That light and power would become a part of her, a tradition that had been passed down for hundreds of years.
After her coronation, Elodie officially received a crystal piece from the High Priestess in a secret ceremony honoring her mother. This also includes fire and energy, a centuries-old tradition.
Elodie's coronation day was marred by the arrival of a contingent of peasants from Caloris, angry over the continuing disruption that had followed the earthquake. Soldiers were able to keep them out of range of the new Queen, but the protest was considered to be a poor omen for her reign.
A group of Caloris farmers gather in the chaos of an earthquake on Elodie's first day. The soldiers freed them from the yoke of the new queen, but the rebellion was seen as a bad sign for their kingdom.
Joslyn was forced to return immediately to his duties as Duke of Caloris, leaving his daughter to fend for herself.
Jocelyn immediately returns to her role as Princess Clarissa. Leave the girl alone
The magical conjunction which ended the Shanjian threat also shook up the established boundaries of the Old Forest. Monster sightings throughout Caloris were on the increase, and entire villages were rumored to have been wiped out.
The magical alliance that destroyed Yama's threat also shook the boundaries of the ancient forest. Many animals appeared in Chloris and rumors spread throughout the city.
Both the Queen and the Duchess of Ursul offered their aid, but were rebuffed. Caloris would not share its secrets.
Princess Ursula and Princess Ursula offered help, but he did not refuse. There is no calorie secret.
Elodie's coronation day was scarred by tragedy. Rumor spread among the commoners that there was not enough food at the festivities for everyone, and a stampede broke out as each fought to be among the lucky few who would be fed. There were not enough soldiers on hand to maintain order, and a number of people were trampled to death in the chaos.
Elodie's coronation day was a difficult day. Word spread among the townspeople that there wasn't enough food for all the festivities, and as everyone rushed to eat the fairies' dinner, a commotion broke out. There were few soldiers to guard it and many people died in the confusion.
While the loss of life was small, the bad feelings would linger for some time.
Although the disease is mild, it can sometimes cause negative emotions.
The following year, Elodie and Talarist were married in a ceremony that threatened to rival her coronation for pomp and splendour.
The following year, Elodie and Tillerist were married in a ceremony that threatened to usurp the throne.
Talarist brought with him a gift of fine white horses, and encouraged his young wife to amuse herself while he enjoyed his new place in Novan politics. He was clearly in no hurry to provide an heir to the throne.
The dictator brings a beautiful white horse and invites his new wife to enjoy Novan's new political position. He is in no rush to remove his successor.
The following year, Elodie and Banion were married in a ceremony she had designed carefully to leave no doubt that she was in charge. {b}She{/b} wore an elaborate gown with diamonds and streamers like clouded wings. {b}He{/b} wore a simple and tight-fitting garment that would have looked at home in the ballet corps.
The following year, Elodie and Bion had an elaborate wedding so she wouldn't be embarrassed by the ceremony. She wore a beautiful dress studded with pearls that fluttered like the wings of a cloud. She looked beautiful in a simple straight dress paired with a stiletto top.
Of course, Banion won a bit of payback when he revealed the parentage of the adorable flower boy in the wedding procession.
Of course, when Binion meets a beautiful girl wearing flowers at a wedding, he can't help it.
The following year, Elodie and Banion were married. Attendees said that the ceremony was lovely, but the bride and the groom kept glaring at each other while taking their vows.
Elodie and Bunyan were married the following year. Attendees say this program is good. But after the polls they will say they are waiting.
The following year, Elodie and Thaddeus were married in a quiet ceremony attended by only the noble elite. Elodie was surprised to discover that for all his rebellious ways, her husband had no romantic experience at all. Their wedding night ended in a cautious truce, with plans for slow progress in the future.

The resulting disagreements led eventually to Elodie's Aunt Lucille leaving the castle in a huff and threatening to cut off all contact between Elodie and her cousin Charlotte.
Despite doubt and uncertainty, Duchess Lila states that Elodie and Thaddeus will marry within a year. Conflict arises when Elodie's sister Lucille breaks out of prison and threatens to break the bond between Elodie and her sister Charlotte.
The wedding, when it took place, was a quiet affair, neither bride nor groom seeming entirely comfortable with their roles. Elodie was surprised to discover that for all his rebellious ways, her husband had no romantic experience at all. Their wedding night ended in a cautious truce, with plans for slow progress in the future.
The ceremony was full of silence, the bride and groom were not satisfied with their work. Elodie is surprised that, despite her husband's rebellion, she has never found love. Their well-planned wedding night is over and the future is slowly unfolding.
Joslyn never properly recovered from his encounter with the King of Shanjia. He did awaken a week after the coronation, but his mind and his memory were badly damaged. He was no longer fit to govern his duchy without aid, much less explain the mysterious events of the duel. Still, he recognised his daughter and was pleased to see her wearing the crown.
Jocelyn wasn't feeling very well when she met King Shangjia. He woke up a week after the king's arrival, but his mind and memory were greatly affected. He cannot control his work and cannot explain the mysterious events occurring in the play. However, he recognizes his son and gladly crowns him.
Elodie feared that predatory women might take advantage of her father's weakness, but Joslyn showed no interest in remarrying. His mind lingered in the past, not the future. He did, however, acknowledge and adopt a previously-unknown natural son as the next heir to the duchy of Caloris.
Jocelyn doesn't want to remarry, but Elodie worries that Hunter's wife will take advantage of her father's weakness. I only think about the past, not the future. His identity as a member of Chlorizin's board of directors is unknown.
Considering her father's state of mind, Elodie could never be sure whether this young man was truly her half-brother.
As for her father's status, Elodie didn't know if he had a boyfriend or not.
To the surprise of many, Joslyn, Duke of Caloris, soon announced his engagement to the youngest daughter of a minor Earl, a woman who had previously been in training to join the temple as a priestess.
Many were surprised when Duke Jocelyn of Karolija suddenly announced that he was engaged to the daughter of Count Minor, who was studying to become a priest.
It seemed that Elodie would soon have new half-siblings on the way.
Looks like Elodie is getting a new daughter.
Once his daughter was secure on her throne, Joslyn returned to his birthplace to focus on his duties as Duke of Caloris.
With her daughter on the throne, Jocelyn returned to her hometown to focus on her duties as Hall of Fame administrator.
He soon became engaged to Brin, the Duchess of Hellas.
After a while he married Duchess Brian of Greece.
He soon became engaged to the Countess Sirin.
Soon after, he met Siren Casson.
He was pursued by many women, but showed little interest in remarrying, directing them instead to his brother, the Duke of Mazomba.
Many wives followed him, but he did not want to remarry and instead advised his brother, Duke Mazumba.
The tragic events of the past year left a large gap in the Novan power structure, with both Caloris and Merva now lacking in leadership.
The terrible events of the past year have left a void in the nuns' power structure, and Cal and Marfa are now leaderless.
As she had been closely related to both Dukes and their territories lay close to the capital city, Elodie chose to temporarily claim those lands for the crown and put them under her direct control.
Elodie, who had close ties with the princes and the territories near the capital, decided to seize these territories for a while so that they could become the crown and directly control it.
This was one step too far for the remaining nobility. Facing the prospect of universal revolt, the new Queen backed down and agreed to elevate minor lords and ladies to fill the vacant roles.
He has been talked about for a long time. The new queen, despite her anger, agreed to appoint men and women to fill the vacancies.
This was met with cautious approval by the nobility, so long as it was agreed that the lands would return to their own governance as soon as a suitable heir was available.
This is done gradually until the land is ready for the offspring to return to farming.
The common folk of Merva, however, were not so agreeable. A minor rebellion was soon underway, in which administrative paperwork and tax revenue were constantly "misplaced", and "accidents" befell any official who tried to investigate.
But the common people of Merwe are not friendly people. Small rebellions soon broke out and "disaster" befell the officials who tried to "educate" public leadership and collect taxes.
Queen Elodie was finally forced to put much of the province to the torch in order to enforce order.
In the end, Miss Elodie had to burn most of the territory to keep it in good condition.
Merva was a small province with few resources and a small population; it hardly seemed worth the effort of sending the royal army in to keep order. A balance slowly developed in which the rest of Nova pretended Merva didn't exist, and vice-versa... and the Mervans liked it that way.
Melva was a small kingdom. with few resources and population Therefore, there was no need to send imperial troops to keep the peace. Some balances are abnormal. The remaining new class, Melva, did not exist. And vice versa... And the Melvins loved it.
The tragic events of the past year left a gap in the Novan power structure, since Joslyn, Duke of Caloris, died with no acknowledged heir to his title. Elodie, of course, was the reigning Queen, which by tradition would prevent her from holding the duchy as well.
Last year's disaster left a gap in the southern power grid. When Lord Calvary Jocelyn died without an identified heir. It turns out that Elodia was the queen who stopped him from taking over all the kingdoms.
In order to resolve the situation quickly and keep the lands within her family, Elodie offered to grant control of Caloris to her uncle Laurent, the current Duke of Merva. The title of Merva, in the meantime, would be transferred to her aunt Lucille, who had always claimed to be descended from the extinct Mervan line. It would then be up to that couple which of their children inherited which territories.
To quickly resolve the situation and save the family's finances, Elodie gave Calori to her uncle Laurent, the current governor of Merva. At the same time, Marwa's name was known to Aunt Lucille, who always claimed that she was born Marwan. So his children took over his wife's farm.
Lacking a better option, Elodie chose to leave the title empty for the moment, appointing administrators to govern Caloris until either she or her paternal uncle could produce an heir of the blood.
With no other choice, Elodie was named Culver's boss until her uncle developed blood and the position became vacant.

A young tanner in Caloris did claim to be Joslyn's natural son, the result of a youthful liaison with a serving maid. However, with both of his supposed parents were now dead, his claim was impossible to prove and the Queen chose not to recognise this possible half-brother.

Cloris, a young delinquent, claims to be Jocelyn's biological child from a childhood relationship with a young woman. However, the death of both parents made it impossible to verify his claim and the queen decided not to accept her brothers' nominations.
As Lumen Minister, Lucille requisitioned the mauve crystal that Elodie had taken from the Shanjian king and offered it to her daughter. Somewhat to Elodie's surprise, Charlotte was able to activate the crystal's power and bond with it, becoming Nova's youngest Lumen.
As Lumen's minister, Lucille asks Elodie to give the girl a beautiful pink crystal from the Shangjian Emperor. To Elodie's surprise, Charlotte was able to open and tie the pearls. Low lumens are available in Nova.
The young Queen wondered if something in the careful ritual of Togami's duel had affected the crystal's resonance. Surely her favorite cousin could not have the same personality as that madman?
The young queen wonders if there is something in Togami's fight that is affecting the vibration of the crystal. Isn't her aunt crazy too?
The implications of sweet Charlotte sharing a personal connection with someone as wicked and unbalanced as Togami were distressing.
This means that the beautiful Charlotte has a personal relationship with the violent and unstable Togami.
As Lumen Minister, Lucille requisitioned the orange crystal that Elodie had taken from the dead criminal and offered it to her daughter. However, Charlotte was not able to activate the crystal's powers. The young Queen pointed out that a crazed murderer would obviously have a very different resonance than her favorite cousin. Charlotte would have to wait to inherit her mother's magic.
As Lumin's minister, Lucille orders a Christmas orange, which Elodie takes from the dead basket and gives it to her son. However, Charlotte was unable to activate the crystal's power. The prince realized that the madman's voice was different from that of his beloved brother. Charlotte will wait for her mother's magic.
With the danger of a rogue Lumen weighing on their minds, the squad sent to deal with %(lucille_name_str)s opted to strike quickly and without warning, aiming to eliminate her before she could bring her powers to bear. Kill-on-sight.
With Lumen under threat from pirates, a team is sent to deal with the situation, tasked with destroying %(lucille_name_str)s before he can use the mine's power to kill him.
The massacre was bloody but brief. The entire Mervan ducal family, plus a number of guards and servants who happened to be in the way, were wiped out - young children included.
The massacre was bloody but short. The entire noble Mirvan family, numerous color guards and servants, as well as children, were saved.
With no heirs remaining, control of Merva reverted directly to the crown, as it had been before Elodie's mother granted it to her brother. While this was easily accepted by the Novan nobility, the common folk of Merva were not so agreeable. A minor rebellion was soon underway, in which administrative paperwork and tax revenue were constantly "misplaced", and "accidents" befell any official who tried to investigate.
With no heir, Melva's control quickly passed to the royal family, just as Elodie's mother did before passing it on to her siblings. Norwalk officials quickly picked it up, but the Malwa community did not take it well. A small coup soon took place as administrative documents and taxpayers' money continued to be "false", the authorities "unfortunately" tried to investigate.
Infiltrating the ducal stronghold to 'remove' one noble while leaving others unharmed is not a simple task, particularly when the easiest time to catch people off their guard is when they are at family meals, or asleep.
Entering the Duke's palace, "hunting down" nobles and harming others is not an easy task, especially when people easily panic during family meals or while sleeping.
While Lucille's traumatic death did produce a Lumen crystal to justify Elodie's actions, it was unlikely that her relationship with her uncle and cousins would ever fully recover.
Although Lucille's tragic death sheds light on Elodie's actions, her relationship with her uncle and sister seems to be fully restored.
Once Lucille was dead, her Lumen crystal provided all the evidence necessary to back up the charges of treason. The remaining family members pleaded that they had not known, but they were still stripped of their titles. For the time being, Merva would return to the direct control of the crown; however, if the survivors proved their loyalty, the line might one day be restored.
After Lucille's death, the crystal lamp gives him all the evidence he needs to accuse him of treason. Other family members, who wished to remain anonymous, were not named. Taj Mahwah will continue to be directly managed for the time being. However, if the survivors prove their loyalty, the phone can be returned at a moment's notice.
The massacre was bloody but brief. Sadly, it was impossible for such actions not to be highly traumatic for the children, Elodie's cousins, who were left orphaned.
The killing was bloody, but on a small scale, and unfortunately the act harmed the children. Who is Elodie's orphaned sister?
A government minister was appointed to manage the domain until one of the heirs was both old enough and stable enough to assume the responsibility.
Executors are appointed to administer the estate until the decedent reaches the appropriate age to manage his estate.
The squad of soldiers sent to arrest Elodie's Mervan relatives met with furious magical opposition. Only two survivors escaped to tell of how huge beams of darkness had streaked down from the sky, ripping soldiers apart in silent explosions.
The soldiers sent to arrest Mawan's cousin Elodie meet strong resistance from the witches. Only two people knew about the great light that appeared from the dark sky. Later, his soldiers dispersed. In a silent explosion
A larger force was sent as soon as possible, but by that time the family was nowhere to be found.
The soldiers were immediately assembled, but the family did not arrive at that time.
Days later, the body of Elodie's uncle, Laurent, the Duke of Merva, was found mutilated in the woods. Those who saw it were quick to put the blame on witchcraft.
A few days later, the body of Elodie's brother, Lorraine, Duke of Morpheus, is found in the forest. Everyone who saw her accused her of witchcraft.
After that, tensions were high between the Novan central government and the Mervan people. Any misfortunes for the country at large tended to be blamed on Mervan curses and treachery.
After that the conflict started between the new government and the people of Marwan. After all, all the problems in the world are caused by Marwan's insults and insults.
Not long afterwards, the Queen was struck down by a terrible fever which left her bedridden and delirious for weeks. Thanks to the loving attentions of her aunt, she eventually recovered most of her health, but it seemed likely that she would never bear any children.
Soon after, Rani developed a high fever, was hospitalized and spent several weeks in a coma. Thanks to his uncle, he finally managed to escape. But it doesn't seem like they have any children yet.
Privately, Elodie suspected that it might have been intentional. If it had been an attempt to kill her with poison, it had failed, but there were {i}many{/i} herbs which could affect a woman's fertility.
Elodie means this. Attempts to poison them have failed, but many drugs affect women's fertility.
Over time, Elodie and Charlotte slowly mended their relationship.
Over time, Elodie and Charlotte rekindle their relationship.
Coded journals belonging to the late Countess of Nix revealed more evidence for her plot to eliminate her niece as well as her husband, leaving the innocent Charlotte as the heir to the Novan throne. Faced with that, Charlotte was forced to admit that her mother had been training her in meditation techniques intended to make her a powerful Lumen someday when she was able to obtain a crystal of her own.
The stolen book of Countess Nyx reveals more evidence of a plot to destroy her cousin and her husband and make the innocent Charlotte the new heir. And one day when Charlotte found Kim, she had to admit that her mother taught her meditation techniques to strengthen her mind.
Now, of course, her mother's crystal was available, but Charlotte wanted nothing to do with it.
That is right. She is her mother's mirror, but Charlotte doesn't like it.
Charlotte could never quite accept that either her mother or her beloved cousin had intended to kill the other. Eventually she chose to cast the entire matter as a tragic accident and refused to speak any more about it.
Charlotte refuses to accept that her mother and her beloved cousin are plotting to kill each other. Eventually he felt bad about it and decided not to talk about it anymore.
Following Elodie's victory over the Shanjian king, the public opinion of Lumens rose to a height that hadn't been seen in a hundred years. Young children would dress up and play at being magical kings and queens.
After Elodea defeated our king The Lumon people's spirits reached a level not seen in 100 years. Children dressed up and became kings and nobles.
Freed from the need for secrecy, the Duchess Julianna and the Priestess Selene were able to announce their shared magical powers and their love. At Elodie's prompting, the lovers pledged their devotion to each other in a private ceremony, after which Selene retired from the priesthood to accompany her wife to Ursul.
Dutch Juliana and Reverend Selena, without the need for privacy, can spread magic and love together. In keeping with Elodie's wishes, the couple exchanged vows in a private ceremony after Celine left the priest with her husband Ursella.
As neither of them intended to bear children of the body, Julianna made arrangements for her niece Briony to be declared the next heir to the duchy of Ursul as well as the inheritor of her crystal. Briony's mother Corisande hoped that the training necessary to make her flighty daughter into a future magical girl warrior would keep her out of worse trouble.
Juliana didn't want children and had her cousin Bryonia declared the successor of Ursula and Jesus. Briony Corisand's mother hopes her daughter's education will save her from serious problems in the future.
Following Elodie's passionate defense of magic and her victory over the Shanjian fleet, the public opinion of Lumens rose to a height that hadn't been seen in a hundred years. Young children would dress up and play at being magical warriors of justice.
After the brilliant defense of Elodia and the victory over the Sangian fleet, Lumnian public opinion rose to a level not seen in the last century. Children dress up and play as clowns.
The Queen and her trusted Lumens sailed out every week to check on the condition of the kraken and reinforce the seals. It was inevitable that others would discover their secret and blame them for it. After all, the old Novan capital had been rendered uninhabitable by monstrous Lumen experiments. A tentacled beast from the deep was just more of the same.
The Queen and her friend Lumina visit the ship weekly to check on the Kraken and check for signs. Finally, thanks to Lumen's unique mission, Lumen no longer exists in the old Chapter 9. and the animals are in the hole
The Novan people were not the only ones to notice the increased naval traffic and the frequent absences of the young Lumen Queen. Pirates from Orcus stepped up their raids in the area, hoping to take Elodie hostage and ransom her for a fortune.
The Navans not only noticed an increase in shipping traffic and the presence of Mrs. Lumen. The orc invaders intensify their attacks in the area to capture and rescue Elodie.
Frustrated to be attacked when she was in the middle of trying to seal a tentacled monster, Elodie chose instead to reverse the magic and unleash the beast in the middle of the pirates. Unfortunately, once the kraken got loose, it was not so easy to recapture.
Annoyed by the attack when Elodie tries to hide the monster in her tent, she decides to change her magic and turn the creature over to the pirates. Unfortunately, once the Kraken appears, breeding isn't easy.
The Queen was forced to engage an even larger naval escort to make her regular trips to the binding site, and the Novan economy struggled under the burden.
The Queen hired a large fleet to make frequent trips to the news, and the Scandinavian economy struggled.
In the dark of night, a young girl, bound and gagged, was carried from the royal dungeons to the docks and loaded onto a ship. There she was joined by the Lumen Queen and her trusted priestess. Together they sailed west to the region where the kraken had last been spotted.
At midnight, they took Hasan out of the king's cave, brought him to the police station and made him sit down. Prince Snow and his trusted priest were also with him. They returned to the place where they last saw the Kraken.
The ritual was carried out, and the sea monster was banished.
A party was held and the animal was thrown into the sea.
Despite their attempts at secrecy, there were many who had caught some glimpse of Charlotte during her captivity, and some who suspected exactly what had become of her. But you had to be careful who you shared such rumors with. If even that sweet-looking young Queen was a blood-drinking Lumen witch, how could you trust anyone?
Despite trying to hide it, many people saw Charlotte in prison and some wondered what happened to her. But naysayers beware. How could anyone believe that, not even the good princess, the sorceress Lumen.
During Elodie's reign, the public opinion of Lumens and magic in general would fall to a new low. Parents taught their children that Lumen power was all tied up with witchcraft and blood sacrifice, and would always lead to sorrow in the end.
During Elodia's reign, the people embraced the Lumen and magic. Parents taught their children that Lumen's power was associated with witchcraft and blood sacrifice, which always ended in darkness.
In some territories, any village outcast found to be in possession of a shiny bit of rock was likely to fall victim to a lynch mob, and the miscreants were rarely punished. Better safe than sorry when it came to magic, after all. Even healers and priestesses were eyed with some suspicion. Who knows what costs {i}their{/i} powers might have?
In some areas, villagers standing next to burning stones were stabbed to death. In the end it is better to be safe when it comes to magic unless the perpetrators are punished. Doctors and specialists are respected. Who can define their rights?
The young Queen sponsored expeditions of trained knights to venture into the Old Forest and attempt to exterminate the monsters within. Unfortunately, black magic would not give up its grip on Nova so easily. Many lives were lost, and with their blood, the monsters appeared to grow even stronger...
The young queen encourages trained messengers to go to the ancient forest and attempt to destroy the demons. Unfortunately, dark magic doesn't give up easily. Speaking of Nova, many people died and the swelling seemed to increase...
The subject of magic and Lumens remained a slightly uncomfortable one for the citizens of Nova. Perfectly fine for the Queen, who had inherited it by divine right, but not something that other people should be aspiring towards. Look at all the terrible things that happened when that power fell into the wrong hands!
The problems of witchcraft and dungeons still plague the people of Nova. It was important to the queen, who traded her position for sacred duties, but no one wanted it. See all the horrors that happen when power falls into the wrong hands!
As an openly acknowledged Lumen, Julianna, Duchess of Ursul, was met with public suspicion whenever she journeyed outside of her Duchy. At times, that suspicion was accompanied with thrown vegetables.
When Lumin opens, Juliana suspects Princess Ursula of leaving her kingdom. Sometimes these doubts are accompanied by rejected documents.
It did not matter that Elodie supported her fully as a member of the noble court. That only led the commoners to whisper that Julianna was a bad influence on their Queen.
As a Supreme Court judge, Wardi was fully supportive. People said that Juliana was a bad influence on their queen.
Julianna's perpetually unmarried state was even more worrying to those with wagging tongues. What if {i}that{/i} influence rubbed off on the Queen, and left Nova with no heir?
Mook is frustrated by Juliana's constant loneliness. What if the army kills the queen and Noah has no heir?
Others known publicly to be Lumens, such as the Duchess of Ursul and the Countess of Nix, were met with public suspicion whenever they left their home territories. Not even the Queen's open support was enough to endear them to the common people.
Some official saints, such as Ursula, Princess of Nice, received official calls when they left home. The public was also dissatisfied with the Queen's support.
All in all, it was generally considered a good thing that the old Duchess of Ursul had been replaced. She was a Lumen, after all, and probably up to no good. But then someone would raise the question of just where she had disappeared to...
In other words: Ursula's daughter becomes beautiful. But, this is Lumen and it could be worse. But they asked him where he was going.
After the halt of the Shanjian invasion, relations across the western sea remained calm and trade flourished. Shanjia's expansionist phase seemed to have come to a halt.
After the conquest of Shanzhi, relations with the Baltic countries strengthened and trade intensified. It looks like Joka's development cycle is over.
Sometime later, a special trade ship from Shanjia arrived with a tribute for Queen Elodie. There was a beautiful harpsichord inlaid with ivory and pearl and golden roses, as well as two paintings, clearly made by children, depicting a pink-haired angel.
A short time later, another special cargo ship left Sangia to pay her respects to the Queen of Elounda. The base is beautifully carved with ivory, pearls and roses. The goddess is represented by two rose petals. The children were painted in bright colors.
After that presentation, King-Consort Thaddeus withdrew from court and spent months involving himself utterly with hunting and the countryside, ignoring his young wife. It took Elodie some time to realise the problem. Not only did he suspect she was having an affair with Togami of Shanjia, but he also had no desire to confront her or interfere at all in whatever she might be up to.
After the game, King Tadeo left his palace and spent several months hunting with him in the countryside. Elodie ignores his young wife and takes time to make things right. He believed that intermarriage between the three medals was not desirable. But they still don't want to discuss or interfere in their affairs.
The loss of their fleet was a terrible setback for Shanjia. However, as with a garden weed, if the root is not burned out completely the infestation may return even worse than before. The King of Shanjia had somehow escaped either drowning or capture and returned to his homeland to plot revenge against Nova.
Shanji was deeply saddened by the loss of the ship. But if the roots don't get enough heat in the garden, the disease can lead to death. Avoiding drowning or capture, King Shankya returns to his country to seek revenge on Noah.
While Shanjia had lost many soldiers, they now had new allies. Leaders of other countries were shocked at Elodie's cavalier treatment of the Shanjian prisoners of war and determined to teach this upstart Queen a lesson. Nova would be under siege for years to come.
Although Shan Jia has lost many soldiers, he has now made new friends. Shocked by Elodia Shangjian's treatment of prisoners, the leaders of other countries decided to teach the girl a lesson. Nova will remain closed for several more years.
Elodie's choice to return all the Shanjian prisoners for ransom made it easier for Shanjia to restore their military to the level necessary to maintain order, but it would take many years before they could field a conquering horde.
Elod's decision to return all Camus captives for ransom made it easier for the merchants to rebuild their armies to the level needed to maintain order, but did nothing to repel the invading tribes. It lasted for years.
Raising a new army put a strain on the Shanjian royal treasury, which brought internal tensions among the former city-states to the fore. It would be some years before Shanjia could manage to field a conquering horde again.
The rise of the new army affected the city budget and brought old problems back to the city. It may be a year before Mountain Homes wins again.
True to his word, Togami and the Shanjians ignored Nova in the years to come, focusing their efforts instead on the far northern continent of Borealis.
As mentioned, Togami and Yamama left Nova in the following years and focused their efforts on northern Europe.
He was no doubt chasing the rumors of "Lumen Shamans" ruling over those barren wastes, rumors which Elodie now knew to be false. Let him waste his time in that hostile land as long as he wanted, he would not find any crystals there.
Of course he said Skeeter ruled the desert, but Elodie knew that was wrong. No matter how long you stay in enemy territory, you will never see a crystal there.
Long ago, Borealis had been home to the largest known collection of Lumens in the world. If their crystals remained and Togami found them, he could become unstoppable.
The boreal is one of the world's most famous light sources. If he loses his mirror and finds Togami, he may be tortured.
Or else, Elodie prayed, the magic itself might turn upon him and destroy him. Surely no one man was meant to control that much power. Even an entire domain was too small a space. That was, after all, what had turned Borealis into a wasteland. Perhaps some remnant of that ancient war would still be active and swallow him whole.
If not then Elodie prayed. The spell will come back to kill her. No one has the right to exercise this right. Even though the whole family seemed small to him. As a result, the north became a desert. Casualties in this completely lost old war are likely to remain severe.
And yet, he did make mistakes. He had failed to remove all of the crystals of power from Nova, after all. If he came their way again, this time the Novan Lumens would be ready for him.
But this is wrong. In the end, they were unable to remove the power of Noah's bottle. If the same thing happens again, Novan Lumens is ready to serve.
What he sought there, Elodie did not know, but she suspected it might someday have grave consequences for Nova...
Elodie doesn't know what she's doing there, but she suspects that something will happen to Noah at some point.
After the failed invasion, relations with Shanjia remained tense.
After the failed attack, Shanjia's relationship is still bad.
First came the recriminations and demands from the Queen of Shanjia, devastated by the death of her husband, which Elodie ignored. Next came the subtler approaches, the quiet gratitude and offers for alliances from ministers who were thrilled to see Togami gone.
These accusations and questions came to Mrs. Shanzi because she was devastated by her husband's death and Elodie ignored them. In addition, the priests celebrated Togami's death gracefully, with silent thanks and gifts.
Elodie ignored those also, which was just as well, since the next thing to arrive was the preserved head of one of those 'traitorous' ministers, sent by the Queen of Shanjia as a warning.
Elodie ignores her and follows her until she takes over the head of a servant from one of the "traitors" sent by the Shanxia queen. as a warning
There was no sign of war in the immediate future, but there was not likely to be alliance either.
There is no sign of a future war, but it cannot be ruled out.
Relations between Nova and Tombula, the neighbor to the north, had not been cordial for many years, as the revolutionary Tombulans did not approve of hereditary rule. However, the two domains had managed to exist in a peaceful stalemate.
The relationship between Noah and his northern neighbor, Tumbur, deteriorated during the years when Tumbur defied the ancestral law. However, the place is quiet and stable.
After Elodie came to the throne, however, that pretense of peace cracked and crumbled. The Tombulans invaded the duchy of Ursul, and Nova was forced to surrender the northernmost county in order to maintain a stronger defensive line.
But when Alodi came to power, the false image of the world was destroyed. Tomoli attacks Princess Ursula. And Nova had to leave the northern regions for safety.
Elodie's reign would not be a peaceful one. Her impetuous bluff of an alliance with Talasse against Ixion backfired; those two domains, angry at having been used and lied to, instead joined their forces to harass Nova's southern border.
Eluda's reign was not peaceful. Initial negotiations with Talus resulted in an alliance against Ixion; Frustrated by abuse and neglect, the two sides joined forces and attacked Noah's southern border.
Still, Nova was not a weak domain. The morale of Elodie's soldiers had been bolstered by their victory against Shanjia, and they had no intention of letting their southern neighbors steal their homes.
However, Noah is not a weak line. Elodie's soldiers are happy with their victory in Shanjia and have no intention of stealing home from their neighbors to the south.
Eventually, Nova would manage to extend its borders southward to include the province across the river which the Duchess of Hellas had tried and failed to annex years before.
The Novaii later expanded their southern borders to include the river valley, something the Greeks had tried and failed to do 20 years earlier.
Weakened by the Shanjian invasion, Nova lacked the strength to resist their combined assault. Elodie was eventually forced to cede large portions of both Maree and Elath, and hope that her future successors would be able to reclaim them.
Nova, weakened by Saturn's attack, was not strong enough to withstand the combined attack. In the end, Elodie is forced to abandon Maria and most of the elite in the hope that the next generation can bring her back.
The matter of the rulership of Elath had to be dealt with eventually. After so many recent troubles, the last thing Elodie wanted was armed conflict between Nova and Talasse. Still, while Talarist, the Duke of Sedna, was the nearest blood heir, he was a foreigner, and the rulership of Elath had been tenuous for too long already.
Regarding the latest Eilat law. After all the trouble in the past, the last thing Alodi wanted to see was a fight between Nova and Salas. But even though King Talhar is a close blood heir to Sidna, he is a foreigner and the Earth Empire is powerful.
To solve the problem, Elodie found a compromise. A promising native administrator would be raised to the rank of Duchess of Elath, and then married to the Duke of Sedna. Their wedding would strengthen ties across the border without weakening either position.
To solve the problem, Elodie finds a compromise. A future heroine, she was elevated to Princess Devi and later married Prince Sidna. Their marriage strengthens relationships across boundaries, without weakness or conditioning.
Tensions remained high between Nova and Talasse. After his initial attempt to claim his 'birthright' was driven back, the Duke of Sedna did not attempt to invade again, but he did institute new policies that made life difficult for traders crossing the border. At the same time, there was a marked increase in raiders and sneak-thieves throughout the area.
Noah and Thalassa are still in touch. When his "rights" were denied, Lord Sedna did not attempt to invade again, but introduced a new policy to make life difficult for the cross-border traders. During this time, the number of pirates increased rapidly throughout the region.
Officially, there was peace, but clearly someone was up to no good.
The official position is good, but may not be correct.
In order to calm the border dispute, Elodie proposed marriage to Talarist, Duke of Sedna, and was accepted.
Elodie tells Talaris to stop the border fighting. Our owner considered and accepted the offer.
Once they were married, Elodie was able to indulge in a point of curiosity by asking her new husband just what had happened to young Adair.
Shortly after the wedding, Elodie ends the affair by asking her new husband what happened to little Adair.
Talarist swore he knew nothing about it - that he would never hurt a child, and any agents involved were not operating under his orders. He was an opportunist, not an assassin.
Tolarist swore he knew nothing. He didn't want to hurt the boy or anyone under him. This is not a crime, this is real time.
#If cruel
Elodie found this apparent lack of ruthlessness somewhat disappointing.
Elodie witnessed this terrible cruelty.
His behavior in the following years gave her no reason to disbelieve his story, but if he was telling the truth, then who were the real culprits? Unfortunately, even a Queen could never know everything.
His behavior in recent years should not lead one to believe this. But if he tells the truth, who is to blame? Unfortunately, even the queen does not know everything.
Relations between Nova and Talasse turned markedly sour after Elodie's open jilting of the Duke of Sedna. Talarist declared himself the rightful ruler of the duchy of Elath, and led an armed force onto Novan soil in his attempt to claim it, tacitly supported by the King of Talasse.
Noah and Thales' relationship deteriorates after Elodie finds Prince Sedna. Talaris declared himself the rightful ruler of the island kingdom and led his army into the land of Nuan with the support of King Talaris.
# Still, Nova was not a weak domain. The morale of Elodie's soldiers had been bolstered by their victory against Shanjia, and they had no intention of letting their southern neighbors steal their homes.
Weakened by the Shanjian invasion, Nova lacked the strength to resist. Elodie was eventually forced to cede a sizable portion of Elath to Sedna, and hope that her future successors would be able to reclaim it.
Noah was weak from Shanzen's torture, so he had no strength to fight him. Elodie is then forced to give Sedna a large share of Ellaton as her heir.
All of Nova rejoiced upon the birth of Elodie's first child - all save for those in the family of her husband, who thought the young prince rather suspiciously fair-haired. King-Consort Thaddeus showed no interest in pursuing the rumors, and was very protective of the mental well-being of his son. Anyone daring to insinuate in his presence would soon come to regret it.
Everyone in Nova was happy for Elodie's first child, except her husband's family, who were crying over the young prince's hair. King Tedio's wife does not want the rumors to continue and is very worried about her son's health. Anyone who dares to criticize him will soon regret it.
The Duke of Maree was appallingly smug about the situation, even after his own marriage.
After the wedding, even Princess Maria was happy with the situation.
It was whispered in certain quarters that Elodie spent too much time alone at gatherings with handsome young nobles who were not her husband. She was the Queen, of course, and had the right to entertain herself as she pleased, but that didn't mean everyone would approve.
Some say that Elodie spent a lot of time alone, with handsome, aristocratic young men without husbands. Of course, she's the queen and has the right to have as much fun as she wants, but that doesn't mean everyone has to agree.
However, the rumors were soon revealed to be the work of the disgruntled Duke of Maree, who was well known to be bitter after his string of romantic failures. Elodie's reputation was restored, and Banion found himself on the end of more than a few jokes.
However, it soon became clear that the rumors were the work of Princess Mary. Haunted by a failed love affair, Elodie's reputation is restored. And the banyan tree was happy.
Elodie tried time and again to convince King-Consort Thaddeus that the rumors were false, but he only withdrew further. Unable to build and maintain a bond of trust, the couple eventually dissolved their marriage.
Elodie tried several times to convince King Thaddeus' wife that the rumors were false, but she refused. Couples who fail to build and maintain a trusting relationship ultimately lose their marriage.
The sadder-but-wiser Elodie soon found herself being courted by the man she had once intended to marry - Banion, Duke of Maree. Even though he was most likely responsible for the disaster of her first marriage, Nova's need for an heir was pressing, and Elodie acquiesced to the union.
Elodie, dark but intelligent, realizes that the man she wants to marry, Duke Mary Bunyon, has black eyes. Although she was responsible for the failure of her first marriage, Nova wanted children and Elodie agreed.
Privately, though, she vowed that the marriage would not survive past the birth of a child.
But she said that she will not marry until her son is born.
# If cruel
And neither would Banion.
There are also such clothes.
# New epilogue variants for >= 1.3.21
A few years later, Elodie and Banion were married. Attendees said that the ceremony was lovely, but the bride and the groom seemed very distant from each other. It had the look of a formal alliance, not a romantic union.
Several years later, Elodie and Bugnon married. Those present noted that the ceremony went well. But the two seemed too close to each other. It's like a formal relationship. This is not a romantic relationship.
Staff in the palace noted the new King-Consort's tendency to defer to his wife when making even the simplest of decisions - at least, in public.
Officials say the new king likes to be with his wife when making the simplest decisions, at least in public.
Time went by, and it became apparent that no official heir would be born. And yet, the marriage persisted, even prospered. Each declared a separate successor: for Banion, a natural son born before his wedding, for Elodie, her cousin Charlotte.
Time passed and the heir was not yet born. But the marriage was wonderful. Each character represents a different agent: Banjo, the illegitimate child of Charlotte's aunt Elodie.
Whatever private arrangements they had come to, they appeared content with their choices.
He was happy with his decision, even though he came alone.
The young queen kept finding reasons to put off her marriage to Banion, Duke of Maree. She was too young. Nova's needs were too pressing. The Treasury could not bear the expense. The priestesses could not choose a fortuitous time.
Queen Mary is looking for reasons to end her marriage with the Duke of Vannon. He is too young. A new need, a big need. The budget cannot cover the deficit. Money cannot choose an emergency time.
In the end, Elodie severed the arrangment and moved on with her life, much to his chagrin.
In the end, Elodie cancels the contract and moves on with her life.
Elodie proposed marriage to Talarist, the new Duke of Elath, and was accepted. All of Nova held its breath, waiting to see what would come of it.
Lloyd Duke proposes to Elliot, who accepts. The Novas all wait with bated breath for what's next.
As the years passed and no children were produced, the relationship turned sour. Eventually, the Duke requested a divorce in order to marry his young Elathian mistress, who was already pregnant.
Time passed and the relationship died as the child was not born. The Duke filed for divorce and married his pregnant wife, Artia.
When that same young woman was found dead on her wedding day, many suspected the jilted Queen had had a hand in it.
When a girl dies on her wedding day, many suspect the hand of a returning princess.
As for the royal succession, it seemed most likely that it would pass from Elodie to one of her cousins, Lucille's children.
As for the throne, Elodie passes it on to her cousin Lucille's daughter.
At her husband's urging, Elodie resorted to herbal treatments in order to increase the chances of conception and speed the creation of heirs for their territories. The potions worked, and the young Queen became pregnant with twins.
With the help of her husband, Elodie uses drugs to increase her chances of getting pregnant and secure her inheritance. The potion worked and the young queen became pregnant with twins.
Unfortunately, the strain of a multiple birth was almost too much for Elodie. She survived to see her two daughters, but her health would never be the same again.
Unfortunately, Elodie lost her life due to the stress of giving birth. He saw two girls, but they all looked worse.
Elodie proposed marriage to Talarist, the Duke of Sedna, but was rejected. Not only did he turn her down, he mocked her lack of charms in front of the entire Talassian court.
Elodie Sednor plans to marry Duke Talerius, but is rejected. Not only was he hated for being absent from school, but he was also criticized at Tara Court.
Somehow, he'd even gotten hold of that old poem about Elodie and the squid.
He also finds old poems about Elodie and animals.
In the end, though, the joke was on him, as it was his younger brother who became the King Consort of Nova, leaving Talarist forever relegated to second place.
But in the end, when his brother became King of Nova, a prank fell on him, putting Talaristus in second place forever.
Elodie and Talarist carried out a long courtship before finally holding a lavish wedding ceremony to which all the neighboring heads of state were invited.
After a long discussion, Elodie and Tolist invited all the neighbors of the kingdom to a big wedding.
Over the years, they raised two daughters and a number of exotic pets from the east. The King Consort never tired of giving his girls presents to make them smile.
Over the years, he took the pensioner's daughter with various animals. The king's wife did not hesitate to give gifts to her daughters to make them laugh.
As the years passed and no children were produced, their relationship grew strained. At last, pleading his desire for a family, Talarist requested a divorce, which Elodie granted. It seemed she was destined to live her life alone.
Many years passed, but no child was born. Finally, Telster wanted a divorce from his family, and Elodie considered leaving him alone.
Elodie proposed marriage to Banion, the Duke of Maree, and was accepted. His sister Brin, the Duchess of Hellas, stood as Elodie's attendant for their wedding. The three of them formed a close relationship and were often seen together; nobles sometimes joked that the Queen had married them both.
Elodie Bunyan proposed to the Duke of Mary and he accepted. Bernie's sister, Duchess Ada, is married to Elodie. The three usually have a close relationship. The old man sometimes joked that they were both married to the queen.
Brin's own marriage to an Ixionite lord was short-lived; as soon as she was delivered of an heir for the duchy, she dissolved the union. At her Queen's command, she maintained cordial relations with her ex-husband, and allowed him time with his son.
Braine's marriage to Lord Axion was short-lived. They broke the bond after the birth of the royal heir. At the request of the queen, she broke up with her ex-husband and let him have children.
Certainly Brin showed no signs of seeking a traditional marriage for herself. Instead, she adopted her brother's natural son (fathered {i}before{/i} his marriage to Elodie) as the heir to Hellas.
Clearly, Brina showed no signs of a traditional marriage. Instead, he accepted his brother (his father before he married Elodia) as his Greek heir.
Elodie proposed marriage to Banion, the Duke of Maree, and was accepted. They were attended at their wedding by Elodie's father Joslyn and Banion's sister Brin, who were themselves recently wed.
Elodie married the Duke of Bayonne de Mar and had one child, Bunion's sister Brynn, who married Elodie's father, Jocelyn, who attended the wedding.
The complicated family entanglements continued through the years. Brin and Elodie developed a close friendship and were more often seen with each other than with their respective husbands, and their children considered themselves more siblings than cousins.
It was a complicated family feud that went on for years. Bryn and Elodie are close, seeing each other more often as partners, and their children see them as siblings rather than cousins.
Which meant that the future Duke of Caloris would be Elodie's half-brother, nephew, and pseudo-step-son, all at the same time.
This means that in the future Duke Carolis will become Elodie's sister, uncle and great-uncle.
As it was unlikely that she would ever be able to bear children of the body, Elodie no longer felt required to make a political marriage for the good of Nova. Instead, she pledged herself as the lifemate of Brin, Duchess of Hellas and installed the other woman as her Queen-Consort.
Elodie no longer believes that Novy wants a happy marriage because she has no biological children. He also married another queen, Queen Brianna of Greece, who became a lifelong friend.
The move was not entirely popular with the people of Nova, who feared to see Latimer's line broken.
The move angered Novaya residents who feared the Latimer line would be cut off.
To ensure a stable succession, Elodie officially named her cousin Charlotte as heir, and granted her the right to use the title of Crown Princess. Charlotte's mother Lucille would hold the position of Prime Minister, while her father Laurent remained Duke of Merva. The title to the Duchy of Merva would pass not to Charlotte, but to her brother Emry.
To ensure the inheritance, Elodie named her cousin Charlotte as heir, giving her the right to use the title of Duke. Charlotte's mother, Lucille, became Prime Minister, but her father, Laurent, Prince of Merlot, remained. Duco Mirad did not go to Charlotte, but to his brother Emery.
Nova would go on.
Nova continued.
Elodie proposed marriage to Banion, the Duke of Maree, and was quickly accepted. All who attended spoke of the wedding as a lavish and romantic affair, and applauded the wisdom of the match. 
Lloyd recommended it to Bennion, Earl of Moray, who agreed. Everyone sees the wedding as a fun and loving event and appreciates the humor in the show.
Soon afterwards, the Queen announced that she was expecting a child, and the people of Nova rejoiced.
Soon the woman learned that she was pregnant, and at first she was happy.
In private, matters were not so rosy. Elodie was plagued with constant headaches and fatigue, and her husband urged her to stay in bed 'for the good of the child'. Soon, she was little more than a prisoner in her own tower, while the new king pursued his political agenda.
Personally, things are not good. Elodie had a headache and was vomiting constantly and her husband put her to bed "for the baby". As the new king continued his political activities, the number of people living in the tower increased rapidly.
Elodie suspected that Banion might have added something to her food to keep her quiet, but it was so hard to find the strength to argue...
Elodie suspects that Bunyan left the food to comfort her, but it's hard to hear...
Not even little Brin's birth could bring happiness to this couple.
The boy's family is very happy with the couple.
Though she received many proposals, Queen Elodie appeared to have little interest in marriage. When she was not occupied with running the country, she spent much of her time with her companion Brin, the Duchess of Hellas.
Despite many proposals, Queen Elodie has not yet considered the possibility of marriage. When he's not working for the good of the world, he spends most of his time with his partner Brienne, the Duchess of Hell.
Brin's own marriage was short-lived and politely broken off as soon as a suitable heir had been delivered.
Brienne's marriage was short-lived and ended due to civil war after the birth of an heir.
Despite her lack of husband, Queen Elodie did produce an heir to the throne - a daughter. The child was acknowledged; the father never was.
Even without a husband, Princess Elodie gave birth to a daughter and heir to the throne. Getting to know the child; orphan
Years later, when both were adult, Elodie, Queen of Nova, and Adair, Duke of Elath, were married. An entire week of public celebrations was set aside for the wedding, and both bride and groom paraded through the capital on fine white horses from the east.
In later years he grew up and married Miss Elodie of Noah and Miss Adair of Elrath. Great festivities are held a week before the wedding, and the bride travels from the east to the capital on white horses.
Their relationship often seemed to be more one of friends and companions than passionate lovers, but they brought stability to Nova.
Their relationship is sweeter and easier than you think, but it provides Nova with security.
Due to his upbringing, Adair was quite used to being told what to do by people older than he was. There was never any doubt who the dominant partner in this relationship would be.
Growing up, they used Adair to tell them what to do. There is no doubt about them.
When the marriage failed to produce children after several years, Elodie resorted to hiring a series of attractive dancing companions for her husband's amusement, so that at least Elath could have heirs.
When the couple is childless several years later, Elodie hires a group of charming friends to take care of her husband so that Aelita will have at least one heir.

until the records show the participation of the queen in the killing of Kira's mother. Now it seems that another civil war has begun, but this time it is led by a prince…

Elodie proposed marriage to Linley%(linley_title_str)s and was accepted. Linley was a studious and gentle soul, who treated his Queen like a valuable manuscript, careful never to smudge or tear her. Sometimes that protectiveness frustrated Elodie, but at other times it was good to feel cherished.

It was something of a private joke between the queen and her friend Gwenelle, Duchess of Sudbury, that one day Elodie would marry Gwenelle's young half-brother. After all, he wouldn't be eligible for years, and Elodie had the whole world to choose from.
It was a joke between the Queen and her friend Gwennell, Duchess of Sudbury, whose sister Elodie would one day marry. After all, even if Elodie hadn't been able to admit it for years, she still had power.
But what with one thing and another, the Queen never quite found the right husband. To her surprise, eight years after she had taken the throne, she discovered that little Anciet had taken all that joking quite seriously... had, in fact, fallen in love with her.
However, for various reasons, Ron fails to find a suitable husband. To his surprise, the young Ancita, who had been on the throne for eight years, ignored these jokes and fell in love with them.
After that, they had to convince Gwenelle that the wedding invitations weren't a prank!
Prove to Gwenlyn that wedding invitations are no joke.
One of the young queen's closest confidants was Briony of Mead, whom Elodie formally appointed as her royal Lady-in-Waiting, and less formally, as the Lady of the Royal Bedchamber. The two carried out a very public flirtation, complete with moonlit serenades under balconies and the ritual slaying of imaginary dragons.
One of the most intimate young queens is the girl Bryony, who makes Elodie the queen and sort of king of the bedroom. Both involved a civil war filled with gossip and a fantasy narrative.
Both women did marry in time, but they never gave up their affection for each other.
Both women married at some point, but never lost love for each other.
Elodie proposed marriage to Banion, the Duke of Maree, and was eagerly accepted. The marriage was a lavish affair, the groom showing himself off in the best possible romantic light.
Elodie Marie Bannon proposed to Prince and he accepted. A wedding is a special event where the bride and groom meet.
After the wedding, matters were not always so rosy. The new king had his own political agenda, and maintaining her authority was a constant struggle for Elodie.
She never turned pink after marriage. The new king has his own political agenda, and maintaining power is a constant struggle for Elodie.
Elodie's fascination with the tanned biceps of a peasant baker was not something she cared to admit openly. Instead, she engaged Evrard for the position of Royal Food Taster, as he had once suggested, and amused herself by watching him sample everything from creampuffs to buttered snails.
This completely eliminates the need for ELO on home baking floors. Instead, he chooses Evrard as a culinary king, happily serving up everything from sandwiches to rich salad dressings.
This position turned out to be all too real some months later when someone did try to poison the royal banquet.
A few months ago, someone tried to steal the royal ceremony.
Fortunately for Evrard, the candied petals only caused terrible stomach cramps rather than anything fatal. Elodie herself tended him through his recovery, after which she assigned him to new, more personal duties. The nobility disapproved, but the common people were pleased to see their young queen in love.
Fortunately for Everard, the milk flower only injured his stomach and did not kill him. Elodie took care of herself during her recovery and then started new and personal activities. The leaders disagreed, but the common people were happy to see their boss.
However, making 'that boy' her servant only emphasized the divide between them. He was decorative and entertaining, but not someone with whom Elodie could share her burdens. She would go on to marry for duty and the stability of the realm, with only the occasional wistful glance...
However, there was a lot of space between them, so he made the "boy" his servant. It's fun and exciting but no one takes Elodie. For the stability of the mission and the kingdom, he married her…
Elodie attempted to locate the baker's boy who had captured her attention, but it seemed that his family had closed up shop and relocated. Alice, the maid, refused to say where they might have gone, not even after Elodie had her whipped and thrown into the dungeon. After that, even Alice disappeared. It seemed Elodie was destined for disappointment.
Elodie tries to find a chef she likes, but her family doesn't seem to be talking. Elodie, Alice's maid, doesn't even say where she's going after being beaten and imprisoned. Then Alice disappeared. Alodi was sad.
Deciding that one handsome face was just as good as another, Elodie turned her attentions to the Earl of Mima, who was thrilled at his good fortune. They had two sons, each as fair as his father - and neither was ever allowed to eat blueberry cookies.
Deciding that one beautiful face is no worse than another, Elodie returns to Count Mimi, who is pleased with her luck. They have two sons, each as handsome as their father, and they cannot eat blue bees.
Even after her coronation, Elodie liked to don a ragged cape and hood and sneak out of her castle to visit a certain bakery. Evrard's father nearly collapsed with terror when he realised the identity of his mysterious customer, but 'that boy' never responded to his Queen with anything other than a cheeky grin and a warm croissant.
After the coronation, Elodium enjoys visiting the palace pastry shop in tattered clothes and hat. Everard's father almost gives up when he discovers her secret, but the 'boy' has nothing but warm croissants and a smile to answer the woman.
It was refreshing for Elodie to have a friend who showed neither deference nor scorn for her position, and for the next few years, friendship was all that it was. However, somewhere along the way, she grew to depend on Evrard as more than just a source of stability to help her face all the pressures of her ruling life.
Elodie is glad to have friends who are disrespectful and dismissive of her condition. He will be her only friend for many years. But as time went on, he came to rely on Everard, especially as a source of comfort. This helps him deal with all the pressures of life as a manager.
After all the struggles Elodie had faced to build a secure and stable Nova, did she not deserve some happiness? She decided to set propriety aside and follow her heart, and anyone who objected was not invited to the wedding!
Doesn't Elodie deserve to be happy after what she did to raise Noah safe and stable? She put aside her courage and decided to follow her heart and not invite anyone who disagreed with her marriage.
Elodie and Evrard had three children, whose tearaway antics sent noble fingers wagging about the trouble with mixed marriages, but the Queen loved them all.
Elodie and Everard had three children, and despite difficult events that caused problems in their marriage, Regina loved them all.
Once she recognised the direction that her heart was turning, Elodie had difficult decisions to make. She was Queen and could do as she liked - but Nova was her responsibility. She might someday need to marry for the good of the realm. Without the full backing of her people, she dared not indulge herself.
Elodie must make a difficult decision when she meets a girl who changes her mind. He's a princess and can do whatever he wants, but Noah relies on him. One day you will marry for politics. Without public support we wouldn't have the courage to do this.
Friends, therefore, they must remain.
Guys, you have to wait.
Elodie proposed marriage to Kevan, the Earl of Io, and was accepted. However, the wedding festivities went awry when the groom suddenly attempted to skewer his royal bride. It was fortunate for Elodie that he insisted on denouncing her at such length that the royal guards were able to take him down without further casualties.
Elodie Duke Young proposed to Kevin and Kevin accepted. However, if the groom tries to deceive the bride, the marriage is annulled. Fortunately, Elodia was saved by the royal guards and was unharmed.
After that, Elodie was in no hurry to marry anyone.
I don't think Elodie is in a rush to get married.
Elodie cautiously broached the subject of marriage to Kevan, the Earl of Io, indicating that she was aware of his 'circumstances' but that they should not be allowed to continue. Briony thought the whole thing was a terrible idea, but agreed to help convince her uncle to leave his sister's house.
Elwood spoke calmly to Abbey Earl Kevin about her marriage, saying he was aware of the "situation" but could not allow it to continue. Briony thinks this is a bad idea, but agrees to help her aunt convince her sister to leave home.
On his wedding day, Kevan spoke as little as possible, even to his new wife. She went to bed that night alone.
On the wedding day, Kevin did not speak to the newlyweds. That night he slept alone.
It took months for him to talk openly about his past. The seduction by his stepfather, the relationship it developed into, the terrible night when his little brother Thaddeus saw what he should not have seen, and then his mother's horrified rejection. Arisse divorced her husband Jael at once, ordering him to stay away from Kevan. When he didn't, she had him killed. Was it any wonder that Kevan had deep problems with family, love, and trust?
Tadeo spent a month trying to get his brother out of prison, betrayed by his father. Nothing was seen in the night of fear. His mother refused to visit him. Iris immediately divorced her husband Jal. and was instructed to stay away from Kevin. He couldn't, so he killed. Is it any wonder that Kevin has serious problems with family, love and hope?
Once he finally gave his full loyalty to Elodie, Kevan's devotion could not be shaken or challenged. Indeed, he would react violently at any threat to her safety, and swore that should anything happen to her, he would not live without her...
After his engagement to Elodie, Kevan's loyalty is unquestioned. He also reacted firmly to the threats against him and swore that if anything happened to him, he would not ...
Elodie proposed marriage to Kevan, the Earl of Io, but was rejected without explanation or apology. At first, the young Queen's feelings were somewhat hurt. However, after she noticed that Kevan was never seen with any women other than his own family, she decided that he likely preferred men and she was better off without him.
Elodie proposes to Earl Cavan, but is rejected without explanation or apology. At first the princess was worried. However, when she realizes that Kevin has never met another woman outside of his family, she comes to the conclusion that Kevin likes men and can do without them.
Elodie proposed marriage to Ignatius, Duke of Ursul, who was not pleased to be approached by a girl younger than his own daughter. While he would not accept her suit, neither could he bring himself to openly refuse after all she had done for him. They entered into a state of romantic cease-fire, in which he would agree to spend time with her as long as she made no inappropriate advances.
Elodia offers marriage to Prince Ignatius Ursula, who is not satisfied with his young daughter. Although she didn't accept his reasons, she didn't want to lose completely after what he did to her. They make a love pact and agree to spend time with her as long as she doesn't make any unwanted promises.
Elodie was young and hot-blooded, and eventually turned her attentions to a charming and muscular navy captain instead, scandalising her fellow nobles. Ignatius, for his part, never married again.
Young and white, Elodie is married to a handsome and cruel sea captain, much to the chagrin of his superiors. However, Ignatius was single.
Ignatius expected Elodie's interest to flicker and fade. She was, after all, young - and he had withstood years of disappointment and betrayal before, first from his father when he was passed over in favor of Julianna, and then from his wife, who had grown all too close to her unstable sibling. Even his children abandoned him, preferring the court of Mead where they had been raised.
Ignacio expected Elodia's recovery to worsen. However, he is still young and has experienced many disappointments and betrayals over the years. The first person to go with Julian was his father. And even the girls, who were close to healthy brothers, were taken to the main course and raised there.
# Note trailing space.  I'm sure it's there for a reason, if I could only
# remember why...
Why would a beautiful young queen choose him? None but she could say. However, a woman who could melt even the black heart of the King of Shanjia was not so easy to resist. 
Why did the good prince choose her? No one can speak. However, it is not easy to face a woman who can break Shanxia Khan's black heart.
After the wedding, Briony made gagging noises every time she encountered either one of them.
After the marriage, Brownie cried whenever she saw someone.
Elodie indulged in a number of relationships throughout her reign, but her most long-lasting was with her maidservant, Alice. The former baker's daughter was greatly envied for the fine wardrobe and glittering jewels gifted her by her royal mistress. Especially the diamonds set into the silver collar that she was obliged to wear at all times.
Elodie had several relationships during her reign, but the longest was with the girl Alice. An old baker's daughter is very jealous of the elegant clothes and jewelry given to her by her royal lover. Especially the diamonds on the silver chain that you want to wear all the time.
Elodie eventually married a foreign duke in order to advance alliances and promote Novan strength.
Elodie marries a foreign warrior to expand their relationship and increase Nuan's power.
The relationship, however, produced no children. It seemed likely that in the end, the crown would be passed to one of Elodie's cousins, Lucille's children.
However, there are no children in this union. It looks like Elodie's relative Lucille will eventually take the crown.
It was not a love match, but the two parties learned to respect and care for each other. They raised two children, a son and a daughter.
This is not love, everyone learn to respect and care for each other. They raise two children. one son and one daughter
Elodie appeared disinclined to marry, instead enjoying herself with a stable of favorites, then discarding them as soon as they bored her.
Elodie is no longer fit for marriage. Instead of entertaining her with what she wanted, he bored her.
The rest of Nova watched these proceedings with discontent, wondering what the lack of an heir would mean for their future. At least Elodie had relatives... it seemed increasingly likely that one of her cousins would eventually inherit the crown.
The rest of Noah's family watched these events in amazement and wondered what not having an heir would mean for their future. At least Elodie has a brother…
Since one of these affairs did produce the all-important crown prince, the rest of Nova had no complaint. After all, she was the Queen. She could do whatever - and whoever - she wanted.
Nothing to say about the other Nova boys. Because of this event, a very important prince was born. Because you are the king, you can do whatever you want and whatever you want.
Elodie refused to be rushed into marriage, wanting for herself the strong romantic connection that her parents had once had. It was many years before she was, at last, swept off her feet by a young earl with sparkling green eyes and a talent for pastry. He enjoyed surprising the Queen with new confections and even prepared their wedding cake.
Elodie does not want to get married, but wants to be married forever with the love of her parents. He was adopted years ago for his cooking skills, green eyes and small ears. He wants to surprise the queen with fresh herbs and make a cake.
The marriage produced two daughters, who were perhaps a little spoiled by their parents' indulgent affection.
How sad it is to hear the story of the parents of two illegitimate daughters.
The invention of the printing press sparked the beginning of a new age of literacy and knowledge. No longer were books the sole preserve of the noble and wealthy; now information and ideas could be easily passed from one place to another. As the birthplace of this invention, Nova was at the center of a storm of change.
The invention of printing opened a new era in literature and education. Books are not only for the educated but also for the rich. Information and ideas can be easily transferred from one place to another. Nova, the home of innovation, is in the midst of a storm of change.
The new hospital funded by Queen Elodie offered medical services to the common people, but more importantly, it allowed doctors and herbalists to come together and share information. Trading knowledge increased skill levels and made better care available to all. Even those specialists who catered directly to the elite were benefited by offering their services long enough to learn.
Founded by Queen Elodie, this new hospital will serve the public, but more importantly, it will allow doctors and nurses to meet and exchange information. Our expertise increases efficiency and we treat everyone with kindness. Having a sufficient number of students has immediate benefits for those responsible for the students.
That information could also be collected in books and sent around the world. Nova might not benefit directly, but thousands of lives would be saved.
These stories are collected into books and sent around the world. Nova may not provide immediate benefits, but it will save thousands of lives.
Elodie was her mother's daughter, possessed of a royal grace and solemnity even as a young woman.  That quiet power would only deepen over the years.
Although Elodie is her mother's daughter and a young woman, she is beautiful and dignified. Peace is built over time.
The young Elodie had always had a way with words, and that would serve her well.  The true battleground of any war is the hearts and minds of the people.
Young Elodie always had something to say about her. The main battlefield of every battle is the human heart and mind.
Artistry was the watchword of Elodie's reign.  She cherished beautiful things and worked to preserve them for generations to come.
Elodia called Arthur. They appreciate beauty and try to preserve it for future generations.
The social calendar throughout Elodie's reign was packed with games and galas, dances and competitions - not just for entertainment, but also to keep her rivals on their toes.
Kalodi's social calendar was full of games, events, dances and competitions. Do not compete each other, it's more than just fun.
Elodie's interest in weapons and dueling led her to invite foreign masters from far and wide to visit Nova and share their secrets.  That expertise would also improve the performance of the Royal Guard and provide security for the crown's heirs.
Elodie's love of weapons and war led her to travel to Nova and reveal its secrets to distant kings. This knowledge will improve the performance of the Capital Guard and ensure the safety of the Prince. The coffin.
Despite wearing a crown, Elodie was not one to sit on her throne all day.  She engaged in travel and exploration whenever possible, keeping in touch with every corner of her realm.
Even if Elodie had the crown, she wouldn't spend all day on the throne. He traveled and explored as much as he could and touched every corner of his kingdom.
Elodie often found escape from the pressures of ruling by spending time in natural surroundings with the royal horses and other animals.  This feeling of kinship led her to declare new laws to improve animal welfare in Nova.
Elodie finds that she can escape the stress of the kingdom by spending time in the natural environment with the horses and other animals of the kingdom. This attitude encouraged him to introduce new laws to improve animal welfare in Novi.
Elodie's studies of history revealed previously glossed-over facts from Nova's past, such as why the Novan empire only blossomed after the fall of Borealis: The old Lumen warlords were forced to flee to more fertile ground after their constant squabbling damaged their homeland beyond repair.
Elodia's historical research reveals long-forgotten facts about Nova's history, and it wasn't until the fall of the Norrisians that a new kingdom arose: founded by ancient warriors a Lumina is their own guest in their house, just escaping after 9 years ago. . It is possible. In rich areas.
That also explained why, from the beginning, magic in Nova was viewed with caution.  But as memory faded, caution did as well, leading to a cycle of magical destruction that waxed and waned over the centuries.
It also explains why Nova took magic so seriously from the start. But as memories fade, so do hearts, creating a centuries-long cycle of destruction.
Elodie vowed to improve the state of Novan education so that important lessons would not be so easily forgotten.
Elodie promises to improve Novant's education so that important lessons are not easily forgotten.
Managing a country is always a juggling act, but Elodie had mastered the art of being one step ahead of the game.  Her information network allowed her to predict the moves of her enemies and outmaneuver them, allowing Nova to gain a little more power and prestige every time.
Running cross country is always a magical process, but Elodie has mastered the art of taking it one step at a time. His intelligence network allows him to anticipate the movements of his enemies and exploit them, giving Noah greater power and glory each time.
Elodie's interest in rare plants and their uses led her to build a private garden and laboratory to develop new substances - in particular, poisons.  Developing new and exotic ways to dispose of her rivals was one of her favorite hobbies.
A passion for rare plants and their uses led Elodie to set up her own garden and laboratory to produce new products. One of his favorite things to do is to come up with a way to defeat the enemy.
Rumor reached Elodie's ears that a hospital had been constructed in Ixion, and that some of the peasants of Maree were defecting southwards to have access to this wonder.  While regretting that she had not been able to found such an instutition herself, Elodie soon arranged a new friendship with Ixion in which rare herbs from Merva were traded for medical knowledge.
He arrived in Elodis while Ixion was building a hospital and some of Maria's people went south to perform a miracle. Although Elodie regrets not having such an opportunity, she soon forms a new friendship with Ixion and trades Marwa's expensive products for medical knowledge.
Elodie's interest in trade and economics led her to treat country management as something of a game, and a game she was very good at.  Why waste lives conquering when you can dominate by natural superiority?  Her manipulations increased Nova's ties with its neighbors and raised the standard of living for all of its citizens.
Elodie's passion for business and finance led her to see government as a game, and she became successful. If you can control your life with a good body, why not be successful in life? His betrayal strengthens Noah's relationship with her neighbors and improves the quality of life for everyone in town.
Elodie's interest in military strategy led her to treat country management as something of a game - a game that she intended to {b}win.{/b}
Elodie's passion for the army inspires her to run in the country's game and win the game.
That meant expanding the borders.  Nova had been an empire once, and it could be again!
This means sealing the edges. A new situation and it can happen again!
That meant building up Nova's strength to the point where no invader could ever threaten its sovereignty again.
This increases Nova's power so that attackers cannot sense its power.
Elodie never truly got over the loss of her parents.  She sought solace in religion, wanting to believe that everything that happened was part of some greater plan, and therefore willingly accepted the guidance of the high priestess when it came to making decisions for Nova.
Elodie is not happy about the death of her parents. They find comfort in religion because they want to believe that everything that happens is part of a greater plan, so they will gladly accept the High Priest's leadership in Noah's decision-making process.
Elodie developed a deep interest in the hidden lore of Nova.  Why had no one properly dealt with the problem of the Old Forest?  What happened to the Lumen crystals of the Novan nobles of the past?  The answers she found would surprise her, particularly the artifact trove her {i}father{/i} had been hiding from her all this time.
Elodie is very interested in Noah's secret information. Why didn't anyone clear this old forest properly? What happened to the glory of Novin Lumen glass? The answer he gets will surprise him, especially since his father has been hiding it.
Deciding that lost was no less dangerous than found, Elodie made it her goal to round up and catalog all of the magical weapons and dangers of Old Nova.
with the belief that there is nothing more dangerous than searching for lost items. That's why Elodie makes it her mission to collect and interpret Noah's mysterious and dangerous ancient weapons.
As a Lumen, it was Elodie's responsibility to defend Nova from monstrous threats. She decided that the monsters within the realm were every bit as dangerous as those outside, and thus set herself to the task of conquering the Old Forest.
For Lumen, Elodie's mission is to save Noah from great danger. He took the initiative to attack the ancient forest, thinking that the monsters coming from outside would not cause any harm to the natural creatures.
Each monster would have to be identified and carefully studied in order to defeat it without upsetting the balance. It would take many years to reach the heart of the forest, but Elodie was undaunted.
Each soul was carefully checked and analyzed so as not to harm others. It took years to find the heart of the forest. But Elodie didn't give up.
Elodie loved the feeling of power at her fingertips. She studied the legends of Lumens of the past: in particular, their weapons and their wars. Just how {i}had{/i} the Old Queens summoned immortal shadows and bound them to their will? And could she do it again?
Elodie likes to feel the power in her hands. He researched Lumen's history, especially its weapons and warfare. How can the old queen obey her wishes by summoning an immortal shadow? can you do it again
The people of Nova learned to fear their queen, who ruled with a wicked whimsy.  Anyone who dared to displease her might be whipped, or beheaded, or worse - {i}set free{/i} to spend the next month in a panic waiting for the sword to fall.  Her rise to power had shaped Elodie into a cruel woman who took pleasure in the suffering of others.
Noah's people were taught to fear the evil that came from the king's kingdom. Anyone who dares to do evil will be stabbed or slaughtered, or worse, wait for the full moon, wait for the sword. Elodie's upbringing made her a cruel woman who loves to hurt other people.
And thus Queen Elodie's legacy stretched into the future...
Miss Elodie's legacy lives on...

And so the reins of power slipped from Elodie's grasp.  Nova would have to go on without her.\n\nBut it doesn't have to end this way.  Make different choices, train different skills, and Elodie's star may rise again!
The power was taken from Elodia's hand. Noah had to go. But it doesn't have to end there. Choose, learn skills and send Elodie to the stars.
And so Elodie traded her crown and her father's life for the love of evil.
So Elodie sold me and my father's crown out of bad love.
Appointing a shocked minister to rule in her stead, she followed her master Togami back to his homeland.  There she was greeted with much suspicion by the hereditary ruler of Shanjia - Togami's wife.
He appointed a team to manage his estate and traveled to his country with King Togami. Shanji's landlady Togami's wife becomes suspicious.
Togami sent Elodie to investigate hints of rebellion in the outlying cities of Shanjia.  There he could watch her performance and test her obedience, while avoiding the appearance of impropriety.  As long as she was an attractive, unmarried, and morally-suspect teenager, she would not be welcome in the Queen's presence.
Togami sends Elodie to investigate possible violence in a village outside of Shanjia. There he watched her play, tried to obey her and avoid violence. Although he was handsome and single, he was not invited to meet the princess.
Still, Elodie found plenty to entertain herself with.  Freed from the expectations of her parents and teachers, she could indulge her every evil whim.  As Togami's minion, she was {i}expected{/i} to blow people up if they got in her way.
But Elodie thought it was funny. Stay away from parents and teachers. We will achieve our desires. As a household servant, he will burn anyone who gets in his way.
As for Nova, they mourned their fallen king and did their best to pretend their black-hearted princess had never existed.
However, Noah mourned his dead king and tried to imagine that the wicked king was gone.
The crown passed to Laurent, the Duke of Merva, brother of the old Queen.  Elodie's name was never to be spoken again.
The crown belonged to the queen's older brother, Laurent, Duke of Mervaux. Elodie's name has not been released.
By rights, the crown should have passed to Charlotte, the niece of the old Queen.  However, Elodie's example made the nobility uneasy about the prospect of another underage princess, particularly one who was already rumored to possess dark powers.  Civil war was unavoidable.
In the end, the throne would go to the grandson of former Queen Charlotte. But Elodia's appearance worries the nobles. Because, according to another girl, they have dark powers. Civil war is inevitable.
And thus the power of Nova was broken.
This weakens Nova.

That's odd.  It's possible for a bird to be confused and fly straight into a window, but only trained messenger pigeons have the politeness to knock.  But why here and not at the dovecote?

I am the queen of what I want and I can go when I want.
#Speaker: elodie_willful
And that will hurt your reputation more than it does mine.
Your name will perish more than mine.
#Speaker: banion
Ruthless, aren't you? Without allies, even a queen can reach too far. And you {i}do{/i} need a husband.
Is not this cruel? Even a princess can do without a partner. You need a car.
#Speaker: banion
I only ask you to consider it. We could do much together.
I'm just looking for feedback. We can do a lot together.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
Hmmm.

Then your honor is compromised no matter what you do. You should have been more careful.

We can be married after your coronation. It will be lovely.
Let's get married after my birthday. Love
#Speaker: elodie_angry
That's not fair!
It is unfair.
#Speaker: banion
Little in life is fair, Your Highness. Was it fair to force my sister to marry her enemy?
There is little justice in life with your reputation. Did your sister marry the enemy out of necessity?
#Speaker: banion
I need heirs and so do you. I am the highest-ranking eligible man in the domain.
I want an heir with you. I am very competitive in this area.
#Speaker: banion
You clearly could not wed your own father or uncle, Young Elath is still a child, and the Duke of Kigal is happily married.
Of course you can't marry your father or your aunt Elati was young and married the Prince of Kigali.
#Speaker: banion
I am the only match worthy of you.
I'm the only one who deserves you.
#Speaker: elodie_yielding
You have a point.
You have a problem.
#Speaker: banion
You are, of course, too young to marry until after your coronation. You will need time to prepare.
He was apparently too young to marry before the rebellion. It takes time to prepare.
#Speaker: banion
Don't be sad. I want what's best for both of us and our domain.
Do not worry. Good luck to us in the class.

Yes, I will marry, but I will marry the person who is best for me and my domain.
Yes, I will marry, but I will marry anything I want and my farm.

And quite simply, the Duke of Sedna has more to offer than you do.
It's simple: Deep Sedona has so much more to offer.

Low chuckles accompany his retreat.  You have defeated him, but not gracefully enough to avoid giving offense.
There was a faint smile as they left. Even if you defeat him, you won't be strong enough to survive his attacks.

So if you want to win my hand, you'd better set about proving your worth.
So show yourself if you want my hand.

The Duke of Maree smiles wryly and inclines his head to you, acknowledging you the victor of this little verbal sparring match.
Duchess Maria smiled and waved at you, and with those words you knew you were the winner.

You meet your father and discuss business news.
#Narration
You're moving with such enthusiasm that you don't realise your father isn't alone until it's too late to avoid him and his... companion.

Countess Sirin. {i}Not{/i} a member of your circles - she's a bit more than a decade your senior, far too old to have ever been your friend.  And yet, not at all old, as noblewomen go.
Countess Sirin is not a member of your circle - she is ten years older than you and your friends. And age is not a problem for beautiful women.

Her color pales, and she releases her grip on your father's arm, mumbling an apology before hurrying out of the room.  You have defeated her.
She cried and opened her arms and begged your father's forgiveness before leaving the room.

She wants something more!
I want more!
#Speaker: joslyn
And it's not going to happen any time soon.
That won't happen anytime soon.
#Speaker: joslyn
You should be careful how you deal with people like Sirin. You need the goodwill of your nobles as well as your commoners.
You have to be careful with people like bricks. We should respect the noble and the common people.

Without more clues of where to search, your agents are apparently unable to locate her.

The man raises his hands, which begin to glow. The demon's power - or his own?
The man reached out to remove the demonic power from him - was it a hand?
Before he can act, Julianna slashes her sword through the air. A wave of energy sweeps away from her blade, striking the man's upraised arms and shredding his skin.
Before he could answer, Juliana threw her sword into the sky. A wave of energy from his blade hits the man's upper arm, breaking the skin.
He howls, and his fingertips elongate, forming golden chains that float through the air.
He sighed, snapped his fingers, and waved the golden chain in the air.
You marshal up your own powers and join Julianna in combat.
Create your team and join the battle with Julian.
You summon magical shields around yourself and huddle down out of the way.
Summon the magical shield around you and sacrifice yourself.
Snakelike, the chains lash out - not at Julianna, but at you!

The chains wrap around your ribs and your neck and begin to tighten. You can see your guards panicking and starting to rush towards the renegade Lumen, but before they reach him, your vision goes black...
His ribs and neck were tied. The guards are panicking and we see Lumen running towards the rebels, but that's as far as he gets...
Julianna seizes the advantage while your attacker is distracted.
Julia was beaten and attacked.
The battle is messy, but brief. Soon the condemned man lies motionless on the ground before you.
The war was chaotic but short-lived. Badass is lying on the ground not in front of you.

This is why magic is important! This is why the crown requires the power of a Lumen, to protect Nova from threats that cannot be ignored!

And why the crown requires good Lumens like the Duchess of Ursul, to train and guide us, so that we will be ready to defend you!

His spells and kills are his. This is Luman, a man I have never met before.

Afterwards, you receive a report from your agents near the Talassian border.  There is unusual activity going on in the duchy of Sedna.  Official messengers have been coming and going between the Sedna customs stations.
You'll find a message from an agent on the border of Thalassia. Sedna is experiencing extraordinary events in the state. The ambassadors travel between the cultural centers of Sedna.
#Narration
If the Duke of Sedna blocks trade between Sedna and Elath, there could be shortages.  The mountains of Elath cannot grow enough food to support its population, and it is generally more convenient to buy foodstuffs from Talasse than to ship them up the river.
The weakness would occur if the leader of Sedna stopped transactions between Sedna and Issa. The mountains of Eilat cannot produce food to feed the people and it is better to buy food in Tara than to swim in the river.
#Narration
However, Elath is not short of funds, and if you prepare an alternative source for buying food, it will be Sedna who comes out the loser for any trade disruption.
However, Elata has no money and if she finds another source of food, Chetna will be a bit unbalanced.

If you guess wrong, you will have to sell at a loss.  Transporting large amounts of goods upriver isn't cheap.

Wherever she's hidden herself, she must not be easy to find.  Or else, perhaps a monster got her.  That would be a fitting end for a Lumen.

Your agents report a buildup of military strength - particularly warships - in Shanjia, the major power across the ocean to the west. They may be intending to go on the attack.
Officials in the country say there is a military presence, particularly in the city of Shanjia. It is the largest library in the Western world. He will surely attack.

Shanjia lies a great distance from Nova. You have few diplomatic ties and no known conflicts. There's no reason to assume that you would be their target.
Shinja was far away from Nova. There are many political parties and there is no conflict. Do not think that you will fall in love with him.

Still, if they send a fleet across the ocean, Nova might be in danger. At the very least, shipping would be disrupted.
But if the car is taken to the beach, Novata can be a problem. There are still problems with the plane.

(And that would be a disaster to the Novan economy. We have to keep the shipping lanes clear.)

While studying reports of trade and goods shipments, you notice something interesting.  The domain of Shanjia, which is now the major power on the western continent, appears to be stepping up production.
You will find interesting things when you learn to trade stock prices. The Shanxia region that occupies the western part of the country seems to be strong.
#Narration
In particular, their increased demand for wood, hemp, linen, and metals suggest that they are producing new ships - and new weapons.  This could be the precursor to a warfleet.
The most important products are wood, hemp, hemp and iron. This shows that they are building new ships and new weapons. Perhaps this is a sign of the sea.

Whatever they're doing, it will take time.  If they intend to attack Nova, you have enough warning to make your own defensive preparations.

Unfortunately, staying calm is easier said than done.  Your panicked screams attract more arrows, and soon, your pain is ended...
But that's easier said than done. Your powerful voice shot an arrow. And your pain will stop…
#Narration
You struggle with the arrow, afraid to pull it loose.  You heard a story somewhere about pushing arrows through the body, so you brace yourself and give it a shove.
When you fight with arrows, you never move. I heard them praising the dead, I went inside and rang the bell.

Unfortunately, this only drives the arrow deeper into your vital organs, turning a painful wound into a fatal one.
Unfortunately, when radiation reaches vital organs, it can cause death and serious injury.

Your aunt, the recent Duchess-Regent of Merva, has not shown her face.  Considering her husband's disgrace, she is likely not considered a desirable guest.  The downside of that is that your cousins aren't here either.

Your uncle, the Duke of Merva, is present, and you realise that you've never spoken to him about his wife's death.  You wonder if Charlotte and her siblings are here.

It is easy enough to attack one soldier, one ship, as a demonstration. But to obliterate an entire fleet...
Troops and attack ships are easy to spot. But if the ship breaks down...

Your long hours of practice pay off.  Once you are in the water, you quickly remove any unneeded items of clothing that will weigh you down.  From others, you construct a makeshift flotation device.  With this you will be able to better ration your strength during the grueling journey to shore.
It takes a long time to train. Immediately remove unnecessary clothing that may cause discomfort after entering the water. Then you do another run. This allows for more performance during peak times.

What's the point?  You know I can't win.  Why don't you just kill me now?
You know the problem, I can't win. You are killing me now

Because that's not the game. You want to save your people, don't you? I want to fight a Lumen.
Because this is not a game. Don't you want to save your loved ones? I want to fight Lumen.

Your game by your rules, for my life?  That doesn't sound fair to me.

If you refuse, then the war will continue.
If you decline, the process continues.

Togami explains the rules of formal dueling to you, including a carefully inscribed circle of wards which will contain the effects of any powers you wield, protecting bystanders from danger.
Togami explains the rules of war, including a well-written defense that applies to whatever power he uses to protect his victims.
#Narration
And then it is time to begin.
Now it's time to start.
#Narration
Unfortunately, you know nothing about safely blocking or absorbing magical attacks.  You can only dodge them physically, and trapped within the confined space of a warded circle, you are inevitably going to fail.
Sorry, you don't know anything about blocking or parrying magic attacks.  You can only escape by yourself and if you are stuck in a locked room you will fail.
#Narration
You trade attacks, countering his spells with your magical shielding.
You put on your magical armor and fight against his magic.
#Narration
Unfortunately, you lack the strength and control to keep such shields up for long.  Your end comes swiftly...
Sorry, you do not have the authority or permission to expand this article.  Your end is near...
#Narration
You trade attacks, one spell sensed and countered by another, reserving your strength as much as possible.  It might almost be exciting if your life weren't on the line.
Switch between attacks by casting spells to gather as much power as possible.  This can be a source of motivation if your life is not good.
#Narration
And then one little spell, which seemed so weak and harmless that it wasn't even worth blocking, latches onto you like a cold and begins to drain your strength.  First in a tiny trickle, then more, the spell gaining power as you lose it.
And some spells that seemed weak and harmless. And it can also prevent the flu from getting worse.  First, some light. Once the spell ends, its power will increase.
#Narration
You must react quickly.  Not by feeding power into the spell to overload it; it would drain you to the point of death.  Instead, you concentrate on gathering your strength inside yourself, pulling it away from the spell's grasp.
You must respond immediately.  Don't be overwhelmed. It will kill you.  Instead, focus on gathering strength within yourself and freeing yourself from the witch's grip.
#Narration
Then you hold that energy inside yourself and wait until the spell dies away on its own.
Then you have this power and expect magic.
#Narration
You open your eyes and grin at the shocked expression on Togami's face - he never expected you to survive that one.
You opened your eyes and your brother was surprised: he did not expect to live like this.
#Narration
Unfortunately, you lack the mental discipline to hold it for long enough, and everything goes black...
Unfortunately, he has no last memory, darkness falls ...
#Narration
You struggle to fight it off, but that only makes it worse, and everything goes black...
He tried to fight but the situation escalated and everything went wrong.
#Narration
You need to end this quickly before his experience allows him to come up with a trick you can't defeat.
You have to finish quickly before you leave your experience with a teacher you can't beat.
#Narration
He's used to dealing with magical attacks, but he might not be expecting a physical one.
He can attack, but cannot attack physically.
#Narration
Perhaps if you rushed him, you could take him off guard?  Up close, he couldn't use his fancy spells.  But what would you do then?
Can you find it safely and quickly?  I can't use melee magic.  But what?
#Narration
You still have to use magic to win, you can't just grab him and bang his head against the floor.
You still have to use magic to win, you can't afford it, head down.
#Narration
Perhaps you could focus your power into the shape of a sword and attack him with that.
Perhaps you will use the power of the sword to kill him.

Or maybe if you could distract him somehow, you could cast a spell that he couldn't block?
Can she influence him by her anxiety?

Motes of shimmering moonlight coalesce into a weapon in your hand.

Your first lunge, he dodges, rolling to the ground.  But you recover quickly and strike again.  In the confined space of the warded circle, there is nowhere for him to run.
When it starts to fall, twist and turn.  However, he was quickly rescued and reloaded.  It is impossible to escape from the closed area of ​​the store.

The final strike of your moonblade parts his head from his shoulders.
The last stroke of our silver sword severed his head from his shoulder.

He jumped up and down and dodged the teeth.  He summoned a shield of red fire that completely enveloped him before returning to his destination.

But that's only the beginning.  Once you are in the cover of this prismatic 'shield', you can create a false image of yourself and step invisibly aside.
But this is just the beginning.  If you are covered by the "screen" of this camera, you can accidentally shoot yourself and go to the unknown side.
#Narration
The strain of keeping up the illusion of yourself responding to Togami's attacks is high, you can't keep this up for long.  You have to end it now.
The impulse to maintain the illusion in response to Togami's attack didn't last long.  I want it now.
#Narration
Stepping up as close behind him as you dare to limit the time and space he has to react, you raise your hand and force out a high-speed disc of solid light.
Reduce it in time and space if you dare. You'll find out later. Rapid elongation creates a storm.

Your father crosses his arms, summoning up a thick gray fog that swirls around him, hiding him from view.  But the Shanjian king conjures a cloud of glowing butterflies which drive into the fog and blow it apart.
His father hugged him and shielded his eyes from the blue cloud.  However, Lord Shanzan brought a cloud of glowing butterflies and flew into the mist to chase them.

#Novan History
You read about the history of your domain.  Hundreds of years ago, Nova was the center of a great empire, spanning the length of the western coast as well as a few island territories.  Over time, your influence has waned.
You are reading about the history of domain names.  Centuries ago, Nova was the center of a large empire that extended to the west coast and other islands.  Your influence will diminish over time.
Nova's history involves an endless slew of names and dates.  Even as small as it's become, there are ten dukedoms - no, eleven now - plus the royal line.  You hope no one expects you to memorise every lineage.
Nova's history includes an endless battle for names and dates.  Growing up, there were ten Duchesses - no, now eleven - and one lineage.  You feel like no one wants to remind you of your ancestors.
No individual may hold more than one dukedom, but nobles seek noble spouses, so titles often come together before being parceled out to heirs.  Your father is Duke of Caloris, and his brother is Duke of Mazomba; Brin, Duchess of Hellas, is the sister of Banion, Duke of Maree, and so on.
Although no one could rule more than one kingdom, the king wanted to take the wife he wanted, so he combined her names before the birth of his heir.  Your father was the Earl of Calvary and your brother was the Earl of Mzumba. Baan, Princess of Hell, Vanjina, Princess Mary's younger sister.
Arisse, Duchess of Lillah, is the mother of the Duchess of Mead, the mother-in-law of the Duke of Kigal, and the stepmother of the future Duke of Elath.  People sometimes call her Nova's Eastern Queen.
Princess Arissa Lila is the mother of the Middle Princess, the mother-in-law of Prince Kigali, and the future mother-in-law of Prince Erato.  She is sometimes called the Queen of the East.

Borealis now is mostly made up of tiny domains containing no more than a few village-like settlements each, officially ruled over by shamanic Lumens.  They have few resources and live primarily from the sea.
Today, Borealis is essentially a small village. There were only a few villages where Lumen Mages lived.

The most important trade route in the domain is the Cavalla River.  It travels through the center of your lands, and almost every duchy contains tributaries that feed into the Cavalla, allowing goods to be shipped along it by boat.
The most important trade route in the range is the Koala River.  Almost all duchies have branches in their countries where Kavala is stored to fuel their ships.

Disruption of maritime trade leads to disaster.  The prisoners and guards on the ship were stationed at Cape Meluchi to warn of the approaching enemy.
It is possible for small locations to be self-sufficient by making a wide range of goods, but if each location focuses on making fewer kinds of goods which they can produce more efficiently, the overall amount of goods increases.
A small area is enough to produce many products, but if each area focuses on the production of certain products, the productivity and value of the product will increase.
Trade in this domain has always focused around water.  However, if more and better roads were built, the Duchy of Lillah could gain a lot through overland travel to and from the east.

#Lore
Only a Lumen can channel magic, and only with the help of an attuned crystal.  The ability to control a crystal seems to be inherited, so crystals can be passed from parent to child... upon the Lumen's death.
Only Lumens and other crystals can cast spells.  The power to manipulate crystals is contagious, so crystals are passed from parent to child.
The kings and queens of Nova have all been Lumens for centuries, but in modern times, magic is only used for ceremonial occasions and the direst of emergencies.
Nine Kings and Queens have seen the truth for centuries, but today magic is only used for important events and occasions.
Long, long ago, the continent of Borealis was ruled over by a single Witch-King, until a rival line of Lumens challenged for the crown.  The resulting war went on for a hundred years with powerful spells that damaged the land so badly that even now, no plants will grow.
The Borealis region was once ruled by the Witch King. Until Lumen's competitors fought over the crown.  The result was the Hundred Years' War, which left the country with unharvested energy reserves.
Legend has it that long ago, a horde of Yeveni on the back of tentacled monsters rode into the valley of Mead laying waste to all in their path.  Their conquest was only halted when a Lumen raised a great flood to drown the invaders.
According to the legend, a long time ago Evin's soldiers entered the glen immediately on the backs of tent wolves and destroyed everything in their path.  Their victory was only interrupted when a massive flood occurred in Lumen, burying the attackers.
Legend says that the island domain of Malini was once a single island instead of a cluster, until an invading Novan queen raised a terrible pillar of fire that shattered the land into pieces.
According to legend, there were more islands than islands when a war broke out when Lord Nobuana raised a great column of fire that destroyed the land.
At the height of the Novan Empire, all the major Dukes and Duchesses were Lumens, and they conquered their enemies with beams of light and terrible summoned monsters.  Those monsters eventually broke loose, killing their captors and destroying the Old Capital on Kathre Lake.  The resulting chaos shook the Empire.
All the Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses of the Cloud-Headed Kingdoms are called Lumen, those who vanquish their enemies with fire and terror.  The demons break free, kill their captives, and destroy Katara's ancient lake.  In other words, conflict affects states.
Two hundred years ago, a great force of darkness covered Nova, threatening to wipe out all life in the domain.  It took the self-sacrifice of the Queen and her complement of Lumens to defeat that doom.  Only the Duke of Ursul refused to join in the defense and therefore survived.
Two hundred years ago, a great dark force attacked Nova and threatened to destroy all life in the area.  To overcome this pain, Rani had to sacrifice and dedicate her heart.  Only Duchess Ursula refused to defend herself and fled.
A Lumen once tried to lift the curse from an enchanted spring whose water was poisonous and glowed green.  After dispelling the magic, she tasted the water and fell dead - the green glow was a not a curse, but a spell placed by a Lumen long before to warn everyone away from the spring's natural poison.
One day, Luman tried to remove the curse by pouring magic water containing poison and herbs.  At the end of time, he checks the water and realizes that the green fire is not cursed, but that Lumen prepared it long ago to warn everyone about the poison in the spring.
A Lumen may willingly surrender control of his or her magic to another.  This was how the Novan Empire came to dominate the world - a growing force of Lumens focused on a single ruler, granting that King or Queen immense power.
Lumen may remove ownership in its sole discretion.  This is how Noah's kingdom rules the world: the power of knowledge is in the hands of the ruler, who gives great power to the king or queen.
It is now believed that strong magical power attracts danger.  Therefore, after the doomshadow was banished, the crystals of the fallen Dukes and Duchesses were destroyed.  Only the crown - and the duchy of Ursul - maintain active Lumens.
Powerful magic was now considered dangerous, so after Shadow of Destruction was destroyed, the Spring Crystal and Duchess were also destroyed.  Lumnes can only be activated by Ursula's Crown and Dominion.

#Speaker: elodie_depressed
What is it you wanted to teach me?
what do you want to tell me
#Speaker: julianna
First, I need to know if you have your mother's crystal.
First, we want to know if the mother wears glasses.
#Speaker: elodie_depressed (Lore success)
A Lumen crystal? No.
Is there crystal in Romania? You are here.
#Speaker: elodie_depressed
What crystal?
What a beautiful mirror.
#Speaker: julianna
The source of power for any Lumen is a particular magical crystal.  Once you've bonded with it, it becomes a part of you as long as you live.
Lumn's power was absolute magic.  When you are inside. I was happy.
#Speaker: julianna
The Royal Crystal has been passed down from ruler to ruler for generations. It belongs to you, now - except that the King may be keeping it from you.
The crystal panel was passed from one ruler to another over many generations. It is yours now, and the king will not take it from you.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
Do you have a crystal?
Do you have crystals?
#Speaker: julianna
{tag=julianna, to elodie}Of course.
It is natural
#Narration
She holds out her hands. Light flickers above her bosom, and then, with a shower of sparkles, something takes shape.
Spread your arms. A light goes through the chest, then a rain of sparks.
#Narration
You reach out to touch it, and it dissolves away into nothing.
Touching it and touching it will make it disappear.
#Speaker: elodie_lonely
#Speaker: julianna
It belongs to me. No one can take it from me until I die.
This is me, no one will accept me until I die.
#Speaker: julianna
You need to find the crystal that belongs to you.
Find yourself in the mirror.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
How do I find my Lumen crystal?
How do I get crystal lumens?
#Speaker: julianna
Your father probably knows what happened to it.
Your father may know what is going on.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
What if he destroyed it?
What if you delete it?
#Speaker: julianna
They can't be destroyed. He could throw it away, but then someone else might find it. No, he'll keep it safe.
It cannot be deleted. You can throw it in the trash or ask someone else to find it. No, he survived.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
But if it's mine, it wouldn't matter if someone else found it.
But it doesn't matter if it matches my name.
#Speaker: julianna
It's attuned to you, but you haven't bonded with it yet. If it found a compatible host, someone who was {i}like{/i} you in some way, it could bond to them.
You like it but you don't like it. If someone like you is seen, he will be caught.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
My father says I can't have the crystal until I'm Queen, so we'll just have to wait.
My dad said I won't take pictures until I'm a princess, so I'll have to wait.
#Speaker: julianna
There may not be time to wait.
Maybe there is no time to wait.
#Speaker: julianna
This world is filled with dangers, and you will need the powers of a Lumen to fight them. You can't begin training until you have bonded with your crystal.
This world is full of dangers and you need the power of Lumn to fight it. You cannot take any action until you come into contact with the Yes Crystal.
#Speaker: elodie_angry
Well, what else am I supposed to do about it?
So what can you do?
#Speaker: julianna
The crystal is probably held under guard in the Royal Treasury. You are the princess; you should be able to find a way inside.
This crystal seems to protect the wealth of the kingdom. You are a princess, you have to find your own way.
#Speaker: julianna
Otherwise we might have to take drastic action.
Otherwise, we have to work hard.
#choice:
I'll wait until I'm older
I will wait until I am old
#choice:
I'll try to find a way
I'm trying to find a way
#choice:
What drastic action?
what's going on
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
No. I trust my father, and he says I shouldn't do this.
I never believed my father, he said he didn't.
#Speaker: julianna
He is trying to protect you. So am I.
He will also try to protect you.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
All right. I will try to get into the treasury.
ok i will try to check.
#Speaker: elodie_neutral
What do you mean by drastic action?
What do we mean by work?
#Speaker: julianna
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
I don't think it is possible.
#Speaker: julianna
Try to reach the crystal. If you can't, come and talk to me again.
Enlarge the mirror. If you can't, please talk to me.

The priestess here is a friend of mine. I will come to your lessons in the faith and train you to use your powers.
You are my friend, I come to you with faith for advice and teach you to use my power.
#Don't do it
#Speaker: elodie_depressed
And, um... if I do that, there's no going back, right?  It's part of me until the day I die?
And if that's the case, there's no looking back, right?  What is my destiny before I die?
#Speaker: julianna
That's right?

You're lucky you didn't break your neck, but your bruises are going to make it difficult to do anything strenuous for a while.
I hope you didn't break your neck, but your swelling will take time to heal.
What's the worst that can happen?  It blows off and someone reads it and laughs at you?  That's better than breaking your neck.
What's the worst that can happen?  I wonder who's laughing?  Better than a broken neck.
Besides, if you're lucky it will rain and wash the words away.
On the other hand, if you're lucky, it will rain and the words won't disappear.

Almost everyone.

I have a great deal of news to report. Everything we suspected was true, and worse.
I have a lot to say about everything we think is right or wrong.
#Speaker: musician
Were you aware that your Aunt Lucille is a Lumen?
Did you know your sister's name is Lucille Lowman?
#Speaker: elodie_yielding
I thought she might be.

#Speaker: musician
... That might have been helpful for me to know earlier.
...I hope this helps you understand first.
#Speaker: elodie_angry
I wasn't sure!
I really had no idea!
#Speaker: musician
All the more reason to warn me what to look for!
I'm interested for many reasons!

Sorry.

I promised to keep her secret!
I promise to keep it a secret!
#Speaker: musician
Because she was so afraid of her secret coming out that she would kill to protect it?
Why are you so afraid of revealing your secret that you are willing to kill to protect it?

Is that what happened?

Not exactly.
It is not so.

She {i}what?{/i}
What is this
#Speaker: musician
I found her journals. They were in code, of course, but no match for {i}my{/i} talents.
I see your post, good, but it doesn't match my skills.
#Speaker: musician
Your aunt intends to take over Nova and rule as an unstoppable mother-daughter Lumen team.
Your aunt plans to adopt Nova and manage Rivera as an unstoppable mother-daughter duo.
#Speaker: elodie_afraid
{i}Charlotte{/i} is a Lumen?!?
Is this Charlotte Lohmann? !

No. Your aunt intends to give her {i}your{/i} power. And your crown.
No, aunty wants to give you strength
#Speaker: elodie_lonely
#Speaker: elodie_depressed
Where are the journals?  I want to see them.
Where are the newspapers?  I remember them.
#Speaker: musician
If I had taken them, she would know her secret was exposed.
If I remove it, you know your secret is out.
#Speaker: elodie_angry
Then there's no proof?
So there's nothing to say?
#Speaker: musician
'Proof' is a thing that rarely exists, Your Highness. There is always doubt.
A nice "show", Mr. President. One more question
#Speaker: elodie_afraid
(If this is true, then she has to be stopped at once, whatever the cost.)
(If this is true, they should be stopped immediately.)
#Speaker: elodie_afraid
(If it's not true, I would be attacking my own best support.  My family.)
(otherwise my best friend will attack my family)
#Speaker: elodie_afraid
(There may be a way to test whether this agent is telling the truth...)
(Perhaps there is a better way to say it, as this employee confirms...).

She never was a very good singer anyway.
This is not a good song.
#Speaker: elodie_depressed
These journals... did they say anything about what magic Aunt Lucille was trying to train Charlotte in?
Is this article about the magic Aunt Lucille wants to teach Charlotte?
#Speaker: musician
Well... It sounded like she already {i}has{/i} some kind of healing power, but that can't be right.
Well... it looks like it has healing powers, but it doesn't.
#Speaker: elodie_lonely
No... it's true.
No... that's enough.

Hi, Adair!
Good luck, diva!
# Adair
Uh, hi, Elodie.
Hi Elodie.
# Elodie neutral
How are you doing?

Okay, I guess? It's really quiet here.
OK, I understand? It is very cold here.

How come you don't have any more brothers or sisters?
Why don't you have a brother?

Mom-Arisse said it's a noble's duty to have a big family.
Ares's mother said that most families were doing well.

This must be even more strange for him than it is for you. He's lost a parent, too. And now everyone else is making decisions about his life. Including you.
He might be more impressed than you. He also lost his father. Ultimately, everyone makes their own decisions about their lives. To print.
# Elodie neutral
If you'd like, you can come to some of my classes. Or meet with the tutors that I'm not using that week.
If you want, you can come to my other classes. Or see a teacher you don't go to this week.

I mean, it's important for you to learn too, right? You're going to be a Duke and a King-Consort, like my father.
