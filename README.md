Here are the files for the Long Live The Queen Google Translated 20 times mod.
If you want to see the mod in action, here's a video of a full run using it: https://youtu.be/xDUc19HNyR0

# How to use
- Download the LLTQ_googletranslate_v1.0.0.zip file from the Releases section. The mod folder you end up with is named "translations".
- Find your Long Live The Queen folder on your PC. On Steam you can find it by going to the LLTQ page in your library, clicking on the cog wheel, selecting "Manage", then selecting "Browse local files".
- Go into the folder labelled "game".
- Paste the mod folder "translations" in there.
- Open up the actual game itself and go into the "Preferences" menu. You should see a new option labelled "Languages." Click on it and select the Google Translate option.
- Have fun!

The dialogue, nobility titles, biographies, classes, activities and moods have all been translated. The menus, tutorial, names, and some text appearing in images have not been translated. It was too much hassle and I'm lazy.

The mod works best with the latest version of the game, but it should run on older versions too (though some older dialogue may not be translated.)
If you find any bugs then let me know.

Feel free to stream this, play around with the files yourself, add more silly translations, whatever you want.


I used the Hypertranslate tool for the translations, it would have taken way too long otherwise. Link to it here: https://www.ravbug.com/hypertranslate/

Here's information from Spiky Caterpillar on translation and modding in general, as well as the tool needed for it: https://spikycaterpillar.com/long_live_the_queen/translation/


Thanks to Hanako Games and Spiky Caterpillar for making Long Live The Queen (aka one of my favourite games of all time).

Special thanks to Prath7 for helping me test the mod!
